Certigo is a utility to examine and validate certificates to help with debugging SSL/TLS issues.

### Features

**Supports all common file formats**: Certigo can read and dump certificates in various formats. It can automatically detect and read from X.509 (DER/PEM), JCEKS, PKCS7 and PKCS12 files. Certificates can be dumped to a human-readable format, a set of PEM blocks, or a JSON object for use in scripting.

**Validation and linting**: Not sure if your generated certificate is valid? Certigo can connect to remote servers to display and validate their certificate chains. It can also point out common errors on certififcates, such as using an older X.509 format, signatures with outdated hashes, or keys that are too small.

**Supports STARTTLS Protocols**: Trying to debug SSL/TLS connections on a database or mail server? Certigo supports establishing connections via StartTLS protocols for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SMTP, LDAP, IMAP, and FTP, making it possible to debug connection issues or scan for expired certificates more easily.

**Scripting support**: All commands in certigo have support for optional JSON output, which can be used in shell scripts to analyze or filter output. Combine certigo with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) to find all certificates in a bundle that are signed with SHA1-RSA, or filter for CA certificates, or whatever you need!

### Install

To install certigo, simply use:

    go get -u github.com/square/certigo

On macOS you can also use homebrew to install:

    brew install certigo

Note that certigo requires Go 1.12 or later to build.

### Develop

We use [Go modules][1] for managing vendored dependencies. If you would like to contribute, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for extra information.

### Usage

Certigo has commands to dump certificates and keystores from a file, to connect and fetch certificates from a remote server, and to verify the validity of certificates in a file. All commands can produce JSON output with the `--json` flag which can be used for scripting. See below for a full list of options.

Advanced examples on how to combine JSON output with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) filtering:

```
# Find certificates that have linter warnings
certigo dump --json $INPUT | jq '.certificates[] | select(.warnings != [])'

# Find certificates that are signed with SHA1-RSA
certigo dump --json $INPUT | jq '.certificates[] | select(.signature_algorithm == "SHA1-RSA")'

# List all Common Names of certificates that are expired
certigo dump --json $INPUT | jq -r '.certificates[] | select(.not_after < now) | .subject.common_name'

# Look for MySQL servers with invalid certificates
for SERVER in $(cat servers); do
  certigo connect -t mysql -j $SERVER:3306 | jq -e '.verify_result.error != null' >/dev/null
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Invalid certificates on $SERVER"
  fi
done

# Find (redundant) self-signed certificates in intermediate chain on remote host
certigo connect --json $SERVER:$PORT | jq -e '.certificates[1:][] | select(.is_self_signed) | .subject.common_name'

# Test if server is requesting that clients send certificates for authentication
certigo connect --json $SERVER:$PORT | jq -e '.certificate_request_info != null'
```
